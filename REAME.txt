This is a simple project on Bank Management
It uses only core java to create all visual effects and no use of visual editors is made.
The whole project is developed on ECLIPSE NEON so the path i declared for used images 
is a bit long and may have issues from command prompt compilation.

To simplyfy the process i am also attaching a pdf version which shows the highlight of
the project.
